# DCF Valuation of Rollins Inc. (ROL) as a Middle-Market Add-On Target

This repository contains a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model developed to assess the intrinsic value of Rollins Inc. (ROL) as a potential add-on acquisition target for private equity sponsors pursuing roll-up strategies within the fragmented pest control industry.

## Overview

Financial modeling, particularly the DCF method, is crucial for evaluating the investment potential of acquisition targets. This project applies a comprehensive DCF model to Rollins Inc., a company known for its stable recurring revenue, to determine its fair value. This analysis assists investment bankers and private equity firms in making informed decisions, guiding negotiations, and enhancing deal outcomes.

## Methodology

The valuation framework employed in this analysis is the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. This approach involves:

-   Projecting the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) for the next five years.
-   Estimating a terminal value based on the perpetuity growth model.
-   Discounting both the projected FCFF and the terminal value using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) to arrive at the company's Enterprise Value (EV).

Key assumptions driving this model include revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, tax rates, capital expenditure, changes in working capital, WACC, and the terminal growth rate. These assumptions are detailed within the accompanying notebook and summarized in the results.

## Key Findings

Based on the DCF analysis, the estimated **Enterprise Value (EV)** of Rollins Inc. is **\$7.68 billion**. After adjusting for net debt, the **Equity Value** is calculated to be **\$7.72 billion**.

A sensitivity analysis further explores the impact of changes in the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and the terminal growth rate on the Enterprise Value, revealing a potential range of **\$6.2 billion** to **\$10.1 billion**.
